THE TODO LIST OF THE ZOOMY FORKNESS

===== SERVER =====

  === USER EXPERIENCE ===

    - Hide stuff that needs an account when not logged in
    - JS validation before getting annoying server errors (also stop projects with no name)
    - Make it prettier!

  === SECURITY ===

    - Confirmation for logout, edit, delete, etc.
    - Better $_SESSION security
    - Maximum project amount

  === FUNCTIONALITY ===

    - Ability to delete a project

===== ZOOMFORK LANGUAGE / SPEC ====

  === ZOOMSPOON (or whatever the scripting language should be called) ===

    - The stuff on the paper in my desk (TODO transfer here)

  === TOOLS ===

    - An IDE that lets you view scenes separately instead of all in the same text area (or group them with special comments)
    - Simulator / debugger / automated tester (random chooser?)
    - Tutorial and/or docs
